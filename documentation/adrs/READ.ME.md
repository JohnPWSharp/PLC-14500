These Archirecture Decision Records were created with Obsidian. Since this is plain markdown you can read them with anything you please and GitHub should display them just fine. Consider opening the vault in Obsidian though to take full advantage of all features.

This project makes use of ADRs to document any significant decision that, some time in the future, might cause one of those "why did we do that?" moments. 

**keep religiously up to date!**
