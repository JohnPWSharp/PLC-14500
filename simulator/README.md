# Simulator

Simulator for PLC14500-Nano board.

This is Work Heavily in Progress. 

A flutter application to toy around with the board while you wait to receive the kit. The app roughly works and basic programs seem to run. Nothing is tested properly though and layout is still a mess.

This will not be part of the first release. However, I plan to polish it later and make a static website out of it for people to play around.
